# GenericHelpers

This library exists to handle a wide array of things that I've found are fairly common to things I do on a day to day basis.
I welcome any contributions to this library - I simply ask that they be written in such a way as to be as generic 
as possible, so they can be used.

All contributed code *MUST* be documented using DoxyGen typical format as this library is also created to help people
learn and understand.
